       linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind LXC,
       LXD, LXCFS and CGManager.</p>

    <p>The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment
       for the development of Linux container technologies.</p>

    <p>Our main focus is system containers. That is, containers which
       offer an environment as close to possible as the one you'd get from a
       VM but without the overhead that comes with running a separate
       kernel and simulating all the hardware.</p>

    <p>This is achieved through a combination of kernel security
       features such as namespaces, mandatory access control and control
       groups.</p>

        <h3>LXC</h3>
        <p>LXC is the well known set of tools, templates,
           library and language bindings. It's pretty low
           level, very flexible and covers just about every
           containment feature supported by the upstream
           kernel.</p>
        <p>LXC is production ready with LXC 1.0 getting 5
           years of security updates and bugfixes
           (until April 2019).</p>

        <h3>LXD</h3>
        <p>LXD is the new LXC experience. It offers a
           completely fresh and intuitive user experience
           with a single command line tool to manage your
           containers. Containers can be managed over the
           network in a transparent way through a REST API.
           It also works with large scale deployments by
           integrating with OpenStack.</p>

        <p>LXD was announced in early November 2014 and is
           still under very active development.</p>

        <h3>CGManager</h3>
        <p>CGManager is our cgroup manager daemon. It's
           designed to allow nested unprivileged containers
           to still be able to create and manage their
           cgroups through a DBus API.</p>

        <p>CGManager has been used by default with LXC in
           Ubuntu since April 2014 and then by other
           distributions as they start needing working
           unprivileged containers.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>LXCFS</h3>
        <p>Userspace (FUSE) filesystem offering two main things:
            <ul>
                <li>Overlay files for cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime.</li>
                <li>A cgroupfs compatible tree allowing unprivileged writes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>It's designed to workaround the shortcomings of procfs, sysfs
           and cgroupfs by exporting files which match what a system
           container user would expect.</p>
